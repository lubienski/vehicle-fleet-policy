**transferPolicy.ipyn**
- Notebook for simulating and comparing various vehicle transfer policies.
- Explores "two-limit" policies to use for approximating values-to-go
- Finds approximate values-to-go for all possible states and time horizons â‰¤ one year
- Compares m-step lookahead policies over one month (m = 0, 5, 10, 30) and over one year (m = 0, 5, 10).

 
**initialWork/**
- Contains several python files used to get initial results (many redundant with transferPolicy.ipyn)
- More details in the initialWork README
